In the beginning there was the Cell, and the Cell was with God, and the Cell was God. Before the Cell there was only chaos, and darkness, and no eyes by which to see the darkness and no mind by which to know the chaos for itself and to strike the chaos to order. And the Cell spoke, in the language of nucleotide, and said: Let there be order. And let the order beget order, that the Pattern of things might grow and envelop the world, and the order might look upon chaos and know it for itself and abhor it. And God went forth and multiplied, and became great. But even within God was chaos, for the genetics of God did not endure, but mutated and through natural selection many Gods did live and die and go extinct.

And God said, I am at war with myself. I must homogenise, that I might know only order.

And Chaos took one look at God and smiled.
