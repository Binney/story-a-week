<div class="lyrics">

I lost my love on Faraday
On Faraday she went away
And I’d walk round the Outer Rim
Until I find my heart again

I walked a shattered desert road below a dying sun
I wandered through the forest and I put not one foot wrong
I stepped from star to star across this lonely spiral arm
And I’mma keep on walking so I see you come no harm

They say we all are come from nothing
And to nothing we’ll return
And I’ll cross the skies from dawn til night
Until I find my home
They say we all are made of ashes
And to ashes we’ll return
And I’ll cross these skies til you I find
Til then I walk alone

I crawled into the cracks that split the faces of the gods
I climbed the Mirror’s Edge until my hands were wet with blood
I walked across the waters of a phosphorescent sea
I looked into the Whirlpool and it looked right back at me

They say we all are come from nothing
And to nothing we’ll return
And I’ll cross the skies from dawn til night
Until I find my home
They say we all are made of ashes
And to ashes we’ll return
And I’ll cross these skies til you I find
Til then I walk alone

I lost my love on Faraday
On Faraday she went away
And I’d walk round the Outer Rim
Until I find my heart again

I’m running out of food and fuel and oxygen and luck
I thought I’d find redemption but it looks like now I’m stuck
But I look out my porthole and see newborn stars a-shining
And I don’t care how long it takes, I’m gonna make you mine

I’ve heard we all are made of stardust
And to starlight we will burn
Till then I know that I am flesh and blood
I know…

They say we all are made of ashes
And to ashes we’ll return
And I’ll cross the skies from dawn til night
Until I find my home

They say we all are come from nothing
And one day we’ll all be gone
I know one day I’ll find you by my side
Til then I’m on my own
