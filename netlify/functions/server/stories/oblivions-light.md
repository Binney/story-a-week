<div class="lyrics">

You crack and writhe
Mandibles swallow me
And I’ll be

Struggle to hold
Fractured and cold
Heavy the burden they bring me
Tighten the rope
Hands at my throat 
Cover my eyes that you’ll never see

Tear me down
Feel me crumble over starlit shores
And I’ll never go, never go, never leave them to the dirt
Break me out
Pull me closer through the midnight cold
But you’ll never know, never know, never know how hard I’d fall
As I’m turning away from it all

_...it all_ turns to air
Grasping hands everywhere
Spark into flame
Taking aim
Calls my name

Brittle my heart
Flesh torn apart
Crimson my fingernails bleeding
Choking my brain
Frozen my veins
Still is unbroken my soul unyielding

Tear me down
Feel me crumble over starlit shores
And I’ll never tell, never tell, never betray those I love
Break me out
Pull me closer through the midnight cold
But you’ll never know, never know, never know how hard I’d fall
As Oblivion’s light takes us all

Tear me down, feel me crumble
And you’ll never know, never know, never know, never know
Break me out
Pull me closer through the midnight cold
But you’ll never know, never know, never know how far I’d go
When the winds are burning
Flow as the waves are turning
Slow til the light consumes us all
