<div class="lyrics">

Hero of London,
punk legend,
we salute you.
Yours is not to ride the sea of outstretched arms all the way to the stage
but a quieter glory
that blooms in the sweaty mosh.
You, Derek – do you mind if I call you Derek? You strike me like a Derek
knobbly cheekbones, antifa skinhead vibes – 
when you hold out your hands to our feet
fingers interlocked
you offer us something much more than immortality
something fleeting and transcendent.
And you’re not a dick about it
you ask permission with a quick nod
and if declined you go on your way.
We owe you a debt.
Thank you, Derek.
