Dear All,

How has that time of year come around again!! We hope you are having a well-deserved rest and enjoying a glass of goblin schnapps by the fire.

It has been a busy year in the Glyphspeaker household. In the spring we celebrated Blackmoon’s tenth work anniversary in his post as Chief Wizard to the Royal House of Aronius. He was blown away by the King’s decision to award him the title Timeless Vizier, which is a very rare honour for a Mortal Wizard and comes with much prestige for him and for the whole family. He has also been granted membership of the Transubstantial Council, and although he isn’t allowed to talk about what they get up to we are very proud of him. He doesn’t get to spend much time spell-casting these days, but his political work keeps him just as busy.

Tundra has taken up needleworking. Although retirement from her druidic duties means she is no longer able to spend as much time in the Crystal Glade as she used to, she enjoys having more free time and a bit of a breather from the petitions of her arboreal constituents!! Really it’s a relief!!!

We are extremely proud of Solstice from graduating from the Metaphysickal College with a first-class degree in The Arcane. Her thesis was on the subject of Unicorns: An Epistemological Reapproach. Lined up next she will be journeying to the Fey Realm to join Queen Titania’s Court and get some important first-hand life experience (and practice her languages!) She really is following in her father’s footsteps!! 

Our Hercules has started a new apprenticeship as a Blacksmith in the local village. He has learned to make Fire Pokers and Tongs and made Tundra a very nice pair of scissors for her birthday. He is looking to move out of Glyphspeaker Tower fairly soon but obviously has a good quality of life here. He talks a lot about a lad who works in the apothecary’s so we know he is making friends. Unfortunately he still has not yet manifested any sign of magical ability, but we are sure it will appear any moment now! Put your orders for Magic Swords in soon everyone!!

As many of you may know, this year also marks the third anniversary of our Lunaria’s disappearance. She was last seen casting a trans-spatial spell during her research into anti-dragon defence at the Institute for Magical Strategy. Her absence has been hard on the family and we miss her every day. 

And finally, I know many of you would not have read this far without the promise of a word or two about Ifrit!! He is doing well after the incident last year. He has learned his lesson about trying to escape from Glyphspeaker Tower and has regrown almost all of his limbs. He has taken a very much more personable attitude towards the family, helped along by a nifty charm of compliance that Solstice introduced us all to. We are so proud of his progress and hope to welcome you back to Glyphspeaker Tower next year to show you first hand how far he has come. What a rascal!! We love him so much.

Wishing you all a very happy Year End and an auspicious year to come, cerddwch yn ddiogel yn eich breuddwydion.

Best Wishes,

Blackmoon, Tundra, Solstice, Hercules and of course Ifrit :)
